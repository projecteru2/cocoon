# Known Issues

## Post-clone IP conflict window

After `cocoon vm clone`, the cloned VM resumes with the **original VM's IP address** configured inside the guest, even though CNI has allocated a new IP for the clone's network namespace. MAC addresses are handled automatically — during clone, the snapshot's old NICs are hot-swapped (removed and re-added with new MACs) while the VM is paused, so the guest wakes up with correct MACs. The clone can still reach the network during the IP conflict window because:

- The entire data path is **L2** (TC ingress redirect + bridge) — no component checks whether the guest's source IP matches the CNI-allocated IP.
- Standard **bridge CNI does not enforce IP ↔ veth binding** at the data plane. The `host-local` IPAM only tracks allocations in its control-plane state files; it does not install data-plane rules.

**Consequence**: if the original VM is still running, both VMs advertise the same IP via ARP with different MACs. The upstream gateway flaps between the two MACs, causing **intermittent connectivity loss for both VMs** until the clone's guest IP is reconfigured.

**Mitigation**: run the post-clone guest setup commands printed by `cocoon vm clone` as soon as possible (see [Post-Clone Guest Setup](README.md#post-clone-guest-setup)). For cloudimg VMs this means re-running `cloud-init`; for OCI VMs this means `ip addr flush` + reconfigure with the new IP.

## Clone resource constraints

Clone resources (CPU, memory, storage, NICs) can only be **increased**, never decreased below the snapshot's original values. See [Clone Constraints](README.md#clone-constraints) for details.

## Restore requires a running VM

`cocoon vm restore` only works on running VMs — it relies on the existing network namespace (netns, tap devices, TC redirect) surviving the CH process restart. A stopped VM's network state may not be intact (e.g., after host reboot the netns is gone). For stopped VMs or cross-VM restore, use `cocoon vm clone` which creates fresh network resources. See [Restore Constraints](README.md#restore-constraints) for all requirements.

## OCI VM multi-NIC kernel IP limitation

OCI VMs use the kernel `ip=` boot parameter for network configuration. While multiple `ip=` parameters can be specified, the Linux kernel only reliably configures **one interface** via this mechanism — subsequent `ip=` parameters may be silently ignored or produce inconsistent results depending on kernel version.

**Consequence**: on a cold boot (stop + start) of an OCI VM with multiple NICs, only the first NIC receives its IP from the kernel `ip=` parameter. Additional NICs must be configured by the guest init system (e.g., systemd-networkd `.network` files written by the post-clone hints).

**Workaround**: the post-clone setup hints write persistent MAC-based systemd-networkd configs for **all** NICs. These survive reboots and correctly configure every interface regardless of the kernel `ip=` limitation.

## Cloud image UEFI boot compatibility

Cocoon uses [rust-hypervisor-firmware](https://github.com/cloud-hypervisor/rust-hypervisor-firmware) (`CLOUDHV.fd`) for cloud image UEFI boot. This firmware implements a minimal EFI specification and does **not** support the `InstallMultipleProtocolInterfaces()` call required by newer distributions.

**Affected images** (kernel panic on boot — GRUB loads kernel but not initrd):

- Ubuntu 24.04 (Noble) and later
- Debian 13 (Trixie) and later

**Working images**:

- Ubuntu 22.04 (Jammy)

This is an upstream issue tracked in [rust-hypervisor-firmware#333](https://github.com/cloud-hypervisor/rust-hypervisor-firmware/issues/333) and [cloud-hypervisor#7356](https://github.com/cloud-hypervisor/cloud-hypervisor/issues/7356). As a workaround, use **OCI VM images** for Ubuntu 24.04 — OCI images use direct kernel boot and are not affected.

## DHCP networks should not use DHCP IPAM in CNI

When using a DHCP-based network (e.g., macvlan attached to a network with an external DHCP server), the CNI conflist should **not** use the `dhcp` IPAM plugin. Instead, configure the CNI plugin with **no IPAM** (or `"ipam": {}`) and let the guest obtain its IP directly from the external DHCP server.

The `dhcp` IPAM plugin runs a host-side DHCP client that competes with the guest's own DHCP client, causing:

- **Duplicate DHCP requests** — both host-side (CNI IPAM) and guest-side DHCP clients request leases for the same MAC, confusing DHCP servers and leading to lease conflicts.
- **IP mismatch** — the host-side DHCP client may obtain a different IP than the guest, so Cocoon's recorded IP does not match the guest's actual IP.
- **Lease renewal failures** — the CNI `dhcp` daemon must remain running to renew leases; if it crashes or is restarted, the host-side lease expires while the guest keeps using the IP.

This applies to **all CNI plugins** where the upstream network provides DHCP (bridge with external DHCP, macvlan, ipvlan, etc.). The correct approach is:

```json
{
  "cniVersion": "1.0.0",
  "name": "my-dhcp-network",
  "plugins": [
    {
      "type": "macvlan",
      "master": "eth0",
      "mode": "bridge",
      "ipam": {}
    }
  ]
}
```

Cocoon detects when CNI returns no IP allocation and automatically configures the guest for DHCP — cloudimg VMs get `DHCP=ipv4` in their Netplan config, and OCI VMs get DHCP systemd-networkd units generated by the initramfs `cocoon-network` script.

Note: the OCI initramfs uses `IP=off` to prevent the initramfs from running its own DHCP client during boot. DHCP is handled entirely by systemd-networkd after switch_root. The `configure_networking` function is only called when a kernel `ip=` parameter is present (static IP from CNI).

## Windows VM requires Cloud Hypervisor v50.2

**Status: FIXED** in our fork and upstream.

Cloud Hypervisor v51.x had a regression ([#7849](https://github.com/cloud-hypervisor/cloud-hypervisor/issues/7849)) that caused Windows to BSOD (`DRIVER_IRQL_NOT_LESS_OR_EQUAL` in `viostor.sys`) when DISCARD/WRITE_ZEROES features were advertised with default-zero config values, violating virtio spec v1.2.

**Fix**: the DISCARD fix is included in our Cloud Hypervisor fork ([cocoonstack/cloud-hypervisor `dev` branch](https://github.com/cocoonstack/cloud-hypervisor/tree/dev)). Upstream has also merged it ([PR #7936](https://github.com/cloud-hypervisor/cloud-hypervisor/pull/7936)). Cloud Hypervisor **v51** now works correctly with Windows VMs.

**Previous recommendation** (no longer needed): use Cloud Hypervisor v50.2 for Windows VMs.

## Windows VM requires virtio-win 0.1.240

**Status: FIXED** in our fork.

virtio-win 0.1.271+ network drivers were incompatible with Cloud Hypervisor due to incomplete virtio-net control queue implementation ([#7925](https://github.com/cloud-hypervisor/cloud-hypervisor/issues/7925)). CH only handled `CTRL_MQ` and `CTRL_GUEST_OFFLOADS`; all other commands (`CTRL_RX`, `CTRL_MAC`, `CTRL_VLAN`, `CTRL_ANNOUNCE`) returned `VIRTIO_NET_ERR`.

| Version  | Behavior on VIRTIO_NET_ERR                               |
|----------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| 0.1.240  | Tolerates error, continues working                       |
| 0.1.271  | May silently fail, NIC unusable                          |
| 0.1.285+ | Fail-fast: NdisMRemoveMiniport(), Problem Code 43        |

0.1.285 introduced commit `50e7db9` ("indicate driver error on unexpected CX behavior") with zero-tolerance on control queue errors. Root cause was a CH bug — the correct fix is to return `VIRTIO_NET_OK` for unsupported commands and to report the correct `used_len`.

**Fix**: our Cloud Hypervisor fork includes ctrl_queue command tolerance (from [@liuw](https://github.com/liuw)) plus the `used_len` fix. See [cocoonstack/cloud-hypervisor `fix/virtio-net-ctrl-queue` branch](https://github.com/cocoonstack/cloud-hypervisor/tree/fix/virtio-net-ctrl-queue) (also merged into the [`dev` branch](https://github.com/cocoonstack/cloud-hypervisor/tree/dev)). virtio-win **0.1.285** now works. No upstream PR exists yet.

**Previous recommendation** (no longer needed): use virtio-win 0.1.240 for Windows VMs on Cloud Hypervisor.

## Windows VM does not respond to ACPI power-button

**Status: FIXED** in our firmware fork.

Cloud Hypervisor uses a GED (Generic Event Device, `ACPI0013`) to deliver power-button notifications on its hardware-reduced ACPI platform. While this mechanism works correctly for Linux guests, Windows guests did not respond to the `vm.power-button` API call — no power-button event appeared in the Windows event log (`Event ID 109`).

**Root cause**: the EFI `ResetSystem` runtime service in [rust-hypervisor-firmware](https://github.com/cloud-hypervisor/rust-hypervisor-firmware) was a no-op. When Windows attempted a graceful shutdown via the UEFI reset path, nothing happened. Tracked in [cloud-hypervisor/rust-hypervisor-firmware#422](https://github.com/cloud-hypervisor/rust-hypervisor-firmware/issues/422) and [cloud-hypervisor/cloud-hypervisor#7929](https://github.com/cloud-hypervisor/cloud-hypervisor/issues/7929).

**Fix**: our firmware fork ([cocoonstack/rust-hypervisor-firmware `dev` branch](https://github.com/cocoonstack/rust-hypervisor-firmware/tree/dev), also [`fix/reset-system` branch](https://github.com/cocoonstack/rust-hypervisor-firmware/tree/fix/reset-system)) implements `ResetSystem` properly. Upstream PR: [cloud-hypervisor/rust-hypervisor-firmware#423](https://github.com/cloud-hypervisor/rust-hypervisor-firmware/pull/423). With this fix, the ACPI power-button works for Windows guests, and `cocoon vm stop` completes in ~13.5 seconds.

**Previous consequence** (no longer applies with our firmware fork): `cocoon vm stop` always timed out on Windows VMs (default 30s), then fell back to `vm.shutdown` → SIGTERM → SIGKILL.

**Previous workaround** (no longer needed with our firmware fork): shut down Windows guests via SSH or WinRM before stopping:

```bash
ssh cocoon@<vm-ip> "shutdown /s /t 0"
cocoon vm stop <vm>
```

Or use `cocoon vm stop --force` to skip the ACPI timeout and immediately kill the process.

The Windows image's `autounattend.xml` includes defensive power-button configuration (`PBUTTONACTION=3`) and shutdown optimization (`WaitToKillServiceTimeout=5000`, `shutdownwithoutlogon=1`) which remain useful for environments not using our firmware fork.

## Firecracker snapshot portability

Firecracker snapshots store absolute host paths in the vmstate binary (Rust serde format, not patchable). This means:

- **Same-host clone/restore**: works without restrictions
- **Cross-host export/import**: requires the target host to use **identical `root_dir` and `run_dir`** (default: `/var/lib/cocoon` and `/var/lib/cocoon/run`) and have the **same OCI image pulled**
- **CPU/memory overrides**: not supported on clone/restore — Firecracker cannot change machine config after snapshot/load; `--cpu` and `--memory` flags are rejected if they differ from the snapshot values
- **Drive path redirect**: Cocoon uses a temporary symlink to redirect the source COW path to the clone's COW during `snapshot/load`. This requires a COW flock to serialize with concurrent operations

This is a fundamental Firecracker design limitation. Cloud Hypervisor snapshots do not have this restriction because CH stores device config in a patchable JSON format (`config.json`).

**Upstream fix in progress**: Firecracker [PR #5774](https://github.com/firecracker-microvm/firecracker/pull/5774) adds `drive_overrides` to the `PUT /snapshot/load` API, which would eliminate the symlink redirect and make FC snapshots natively portable. Track this PR for future simplification.

## Firecracker virtio-blk serial numbers

Firecracker does not support virtio-blk serial numbers. Cocoon's OCI init script (`overlay.sh`) uses device paths (`/dev/vdX`) instead of serial names to identify disks when booting under Firecracker. OCI images built from `os-image/ubuntu/overlay.sh` (v0.3+) support both formats automatically. Older images must be rebuilt to work with `--fc`.

## Firecracker clone guest MAC address

Firecracker does not support overriding the guest MAC address during snapshot/load. Cloned FC VMs retain the source VM's guest MAC (baked into the vmstate binary). In Cocoon's TC redirect architecture, each VM runs in an isolated network namespace, so MAC identity is not visible to other VMs or the host bridge — **no MAC conflict occurs in practice**.

On CNI plugins with strict per-veth MAC enforcement (Cilium eBPF, Calico eBPF), the guest MAC vs veth MAC mismatch could theoretically cause packet drops. This has not been observed in testing with the standard bridge CNI.

**Upstream status**: FC's `NetworkOverride` struct only has `iface_id` and `host_dev_name` — no `guest_mac` field. Adding it would follow the existing `VsockOverride` pattern. No issue or PR exists yet.

**Workaround**: If MAC matching is required, run `ip link set dev ethX address <new-mac>` inside the guest after clone (the post-clone hints print the expected MAC values).
