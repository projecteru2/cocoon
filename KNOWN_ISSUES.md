# Known Issues

## Post-clone IP conflict window

After `cocoon vm clone`, the cloned VM resumes with the **original VM's IP address** configured inside the guest, even though CNI has allocated a new IP for the clone's network namespace. MAC addresses are handled automatically — during clone, the snapshot's old NICs are hot-swapped (removed and re-added with new MACs) while the VM is paused, so the guest wakes up with correct MACs. The clone can still reach the network during the IP conflict window because:

- The entire data path is **L2** (TC ingress redirect + bridge) — no component checks whether the guest's source IP matches the CNI-allocated IP.
- Standard **bridge CNI does not enforce IP ↔ veth binding** at the data plane. The `host-local` IPAM only tracks allocations in its control-plane state files; it does not install data-plane rules.

**Consequence**: if the original VM is still running, both VMs advertise the same IP via ARP with different MACs. The upstream gateway flaps between the two MACs, causing **intermittent connectivity loss for both VMs** until the clone's guest IP is reconfigured.

**Mitigation**: run the post-clone guest setup commands printed by `cocoon vm clone` as soon as possible (see [Post-Clone Guest Setup](README.md#post-clone-guest-setup)). For cloudimg VMs this means re-running `cloud-init`; for OCI VMs this means `ip addr flush` + reconfigure with the new IP.

## Clone resource constraints

Clone resources (CPU, memory, storage, NICs) can only be **increased**, never decreased below the snapshot's original values. See [Clone Constraints](README.md#clone-constraints) for details.

## Restore requires a running VM

`cocoon vm restore` only works on running VMs — it relies on the existing network namespace (netns, tap devices, TC redirect) surviving the CH process restart. A stopped VM's network state may not be intact (e.g., after host reboot the netns is gone). For stopped VMs or cross-VM restore, use `cocoon vm clone` which creates fresh network resources. See [Restore Constraints](README.md#restore-constraints) for all requirements.

## OCI VM multi-NIC kernel IP limitation

OCI VMs use the kernel `ip=` boot parameter for network configuration. While multiple `ip=` parameters can be specified, the Linux kernel only reliably configures **one interface** via this mechanism — subsequent `ip=` parameters may be silently ignored or produce inconsistent results depending on kernel version.

**Consequence**: on a cold boot (stop + start) of an OCI VM with multiple NICs, only the first NIC receives its IP from the kernel `ip=` parameter. Additional NICs must be configured by the guest init system (e.g., systemd-networkd `.network` files written by the post-clone hints).

**Workaround**: the post-clone setup hints write persistent MAC-based systemd-networkd configs for **all** NICs. These survive reboots and correctly configure every interface regardless of the kernel `ip=` limitation.

## Non-root user creation requires cloud-init final stage

When `--user` specifies a non-root username (e.g. `--user admin`), the user is created via cloud-init `runcmd` which runs in the **final stage** — after networking, SSH key generation, and other modules. This means:

- The user does not exist until cloud-init fully completes (typically 20-30s after boot)
- SSH login as the custom user will fail if attempted before cloud-init finishes
- `cloud-init status` shows `done` when the user is ready

The root user's password is set via `chpasswd` (config stage, earlier) and is available sooner, but `--user admin` deliberately does not set a root password — root stays locked for security.

**Workaround**: wait for `cloud-init status: done` before attempting SSH. The default `root`/`cocoon` credentials use the faster `chpasswd` path and are available immediately after SSH starts.

## Clone preserves guest credentials from snapshot

Clone regenerates cidata for **network reconfiguration only** — it does not inject new user or password settings. The cloned VM's credentials are whatever the source VM had in `/etc/shadow` at snapshot time.

- `--user`/`--password` flags are not available on `cocoon vm clone`
- If you need different credentials, change them inside the guest after boot

This is by design: clone restores the VM's exact state including all account settings.

## Clone/restore disk queue count is immutable

When cloning or restoring a VM with a different `--cpu` value, the disk `num_queues` (one queue per vCPU) retains the snapshot's original value. This is because `num_queues` is part of the virtio-blk device state baked into the binary snapshot — changing it in `config.json` causes Cloud Hypervisor to crash on `vm.restore`.

`--disk-queue-size` (ring depth per queue) **is** correctly patched on clone/restore, since it is a software-layer configuration that CH re-reads from `config.json` during restore.

**Consequence**: a VM cloned with `--cpu 8` from a 2-vCPU snapshot still runs disks with 2 queues (not 8). Disk I/O is functional but does not scale to the new vCPU count.

**Workaround**: none — this is a CH architectural limitation. Create a fresh VM with the desired CPU count instead of cloning if disk multi-queue scaling is critical.

## Cloud image UEFI boot compatibility

Cocoon uses [rust-hypervisor-firmware](https://github.com/cloud-hypervisor/rust-hypervisor-firmware) (`CLOUDHV.fd`) for cloud image UEFI boot. This firmware implements a minimal EFI specification and does **not** support the `InstallMultipleProtocolInterfaces()` call required by newer distributions.

**Affected images** (kernel panic on boot — GRUB loads kernel but not initrd):

- Ubuntu 24.04 (Noble) and later
- Debian 13 (Trixie) and later

**Working images**:

- Ubuntu 22.04 (Jammy)

This is an upstream issue tracked in [rust-hypervisor-firmware#333](https://github.com/cloud-hypervisor/rust-hypervisor-firmware/issues/333) and [cloud-hypervisor#7356](https://github.com/cloud-hypervisor/cloud-hypervisor/issues/7356). As a workaround, use **OCI VM images** for Ubuntu 24.04 — OCI images use direct kernel boot and are not affected.

## DHCP networks should not use DHCP IPAM in CNI

When using a DHCP-based network (e.g., macvlan attached to a network with an external DHCP server), the CNI conflist should **not** use the `dhcp` IPAM plugin. Instead, configure the CNI plugin with **no IPAM** (or `"ipam": {}`) and let the guest obtain its IP directly from the external DHCP server.

The `dhcp` IPAM plugin runs a host-side DHCP client that competes with the guest's own DHCP client, causing:

- **Duplicate DHCP requests** — both host-side (CNI IPAM) and guest-side DHCP clients request leases for the same MAC, confusing DHCP servers and leading to lease conflicts.
- **IP mismatch** — the host-side DHCP client may obtain a different IP than the guest, so Cocoon's recorded IP does not match the guest's actual IP.
- **Lease renewal failures** — the CNI `dhcp` daemon must remain running to renew leases; if it crashes or is restarted, the host-side lease expires while the guest keeps using the IP.

This applies to **all CNI plugins** where the upstream network provides DHCP (bridge with external DHCP, macvlan, ipvlan, etc.). The correct approach is:

```json
{
  "cniVersion": "1.0.0",
  "name": "my-dhcp-network",
  "plugins": [
    {
      "type": "macvlan",
      "master": "eth0",
      "mode": "bridge",
      "ipam": {}
    }
  ]
}
```

Cocoon detects when CNI returns no IP allocation and automatically configures the guest for DHCP — cloudimg VMs get `DHCP=ipv4` in their Netplan config, and OCI VMs get DHCP systemd-networkd units generated by the initramfs `cocoon-network` script.

Note: the OCI initramfs uses `IP=off` to prevent the initramfs from running its own DHCP client during boot. DHCP is handled entirely by systemd-networkd after switch_root. The `configure_networking` function is only called when a kernel `ip=` parameter is present (static IP from CNI).

## Windows VM requires Cloud Hypervisor v50.2

**Status: FIXED** in our fork and upstream.

Cloud Hypervisor v51.x had a regression ([#7849](https://github.com/cloud-hypervisor/cloud-hypervisor/issues/7849)) that caused Windows to BSOD (`DRIVER_IRQL_NOT_LESS_OR_EQUAL` in `viostor.sys`) when DISCARD/WRITE_ZEROES features were advertised with default-zero config values, violating virtio spec v1.2.

**Fix**: the DISCARD fix is included in our Cloud Hypervisor fork ([cocoonstack/cloud-hypervisor `dev` branch](https://github.com/cocoonstack/cloud-hypervisor/tree/dev)). Upstream has also merged it ([PR #7936](https://github.com/cloud-hypervisor/cloud-hypervisor/pull/7936)). Cloud Hypervisor **v51** now works correctly with Windows VMs.

**Previous recommendation** (no longer needed): use Cloud Hypervisor v50.2 for Windows VMs.

## Windows VM requires virtio-win 0.1.240

**Status: FIXED** in our fork.

virtio-win 0.1.271+ network drivers were incompatible with Cloud Hypervisor due to incomplete virtio-net control queue implementation ([#7925](https://github.com/cloud-hypervisor/cloud-hypervisor/issues/7925)). CH only handled `CTRL_MQ` and `CTRL_GUEST_OFFLOADS`; all other commands (`CTRL_RX`, `CTRL_MAC`, `CTRL_VLAN`, `CTRL_ANNOUNCE`) returned `VIRTIO_NET_ERR`.

| Version  | Behavior on VIRTIO_NET_ERR                               |
|----------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| 0.1.240  | Tolerates error, continues working                       |
| 0.1.271  | May silently fail, NIC unusable                          |
| 0.1.285+ | Fail-fast: NdisMRemoveMiniport(), Problem Code 43        |

0.1.285 introduced commit `50e7db9` ("indicate driver error on unexpected CX behavior") with zero-tolerance on control queue errors. Root cause was a CH bug — the correct fix is to return `VIRTIO_NET_OK` for unsupported commands and to report the correct `used_len`.

**Fix**: our Cloud Hypervisor fork includes ctrl_queue command tolerance (from [@liuw](https://github.com/liuw)) plus the `used_len` fix. See [cocoonstack/cloud-hypervisor `fix/virtio-net-ctrl-queue` branch](https://github.com/cocoonstack/cloud-hypervisor/tree/fix/virtio-net-ctrl-queue) (also merged into the [`dev` branch](https://github.com/cocoonstack/cloud-hypervisor/tree/dev)). virtio-win **0.1.285** now works. No upstream PR exists yet.

**Previous recommendation** (no longer needed): use virtio-win 0.1.240 for Windows VMs on Cloud Hypervisor.

## Windows VM does not respond to ACPI power-button

**Status: FIXED** in our firmware fork.

Cloud Hypervisor uses a GED (Generic Event Device, `ACPI0013`) to deliver power-button notifications on its hardware-reduced ACPI platform. While this mechanism works correctly for Linux guests, Windows guests did not respond to the `vm.power-button` API call — no power-button event appeared in the Windows event log (`Event ID 109`).

**Root cause**: the EFI `ResetSystem` runtime service in [rust-hypervisor-firmware](https://github.com/cloud-hypervisor/rust-hypervisor-firmware) was a no-op. When Windows attempted a graceful shutdown via the UEFI reset path, nothing happened. Tracked in [cloud-hypervisor/rust-hypervisor-firmware#422](https://github.com/cloud-hypervisor/rust-hypervisor-firmware/issues/422) and [cloud-hypervisor/cloud-hypervisor#7929](https://github.com/cloud-hypervisor/cloud-hypervisor/issues/7929).

**Fix**: our firmware fork ([cocoonstack/rust-hypervisor-firmware `dev` branch](https://github.com/cocoonstack/rust-hypervisor-firmware/tree/dev), also [`fix/reset-system` branch](https://github.com/cocoonstack/rust-hypervisor-firmware/tree/fix/reset-system)) implements `ResetSystem` properly. Upstream PR: [cloud-hypervisor/rust-hypervisor-firmware#423](https://github.com/cloud-hypervisor/rust-hypervisor-firmware/pull/423). With this fix, the ACPI power-button works for Windows guests, and `cocoon vm stop` completes in ~8-13 seconds on a fully booted VM.

**Timing caveat**: the Windows ACPI shutdown handler needs ~60 seconds from cold boot to fully initialize (SAC appears at ~30s, handler ready ~30s later). Stopping a Windows VM before the handler is ready triggers the 30s `stop_timeout_seconds` fallback and escalates to force-kill. Clone-restored VMs inherit the ready ACPI state and shut down in ~8-13s immediately.

**Previous consequence** (no longer applies with our firmware fork): `cocoon vm stop` always timed out on Windows VMs (default 30s), then fell back to `vm.shutdown` → SIGTERM → SIGKILL.

**Previous workaround** (no longer needed with our firmware fork): shut down Windows guests via SSH or WinRM before stopping:

```bash
ssh cocoon@<vm-ip> "shutdown /s /t 0"
cocoon vm stop <vm>
```

Or use `cocoon vm stop --force` to skip the ACPI timeout and immediately kill the process.

The Windows image's `autounattend.xml` includes defensive power-button configuration (`PBUTTONACTION=3`) and shutdown optimization (`WaitToKillServiceTimeout=5000`, `shutdownwithoutlogon=1`) which remain useful for environments not using our firmware fork.

## Windows VM balloon disabled

**Status: WONTFIX** — disabled by design.

Cocoon does not attach a virtio-balloon device to Windows VMs (`--windows`). The virtio-win balloon driver >= 0.1.262 ([PR #1157](https://github.com/virtio-win/kvm-guest-drivers-windows/pull/1157), "cope with the unresponsive host") changed balloon deflation behavior: when the host does not ACK a balloon page-batch within 1 second, the driver now **retries indefinitely** instead of giving up. This causes two problems during ACPI power-button shutdown:

1. **Deflation CPU storm**: Windows begins tearing down virtio devices during shutdown. The balloon driver attempts to deflate (return all reclaimed pages to the guest) one 512-page batch at a time, retrying on every host timeout. This pins all vCPUs at 100% for 2–3 minutes ([virtio-win #1148](https://github.com/virtio-win/kvm-guest-drivers-windows/issues/1148), open, unresolved upstream).

2. **Watchdog reboot**: Cloud Hypervisor's virtio-watchdog has a 20-second timeout. Windows stops petting the watchdog during shutdown, and the balloon deflation outlasts the timeout — the watchdog triggers a VM reset before Windows can call UEFI `ResetSystem` to write to the ACPI shutdown port (0x600). The VM reboots instead of powering off.

virtio-win 0.1.240 did not have this problem because its balloon driver gave up on the first host timeout, allowing Windows to proceed to `ResetSystem` quickly (~14 seconds total shutdown).

**Workaround if balloon is needed**: increase `stop_timeout_seconds` to 180+ and apply the watchdog-pause patch to Cloud Hypervisor (pause the watchdog timer when `vm.power-button` is received).

## Firecracker snapshot portability

Firecracker snapshots store absolute host paths in the vmstate binary (Rust serde format, not patchable). This means:

- **Same-host clone/restore**: works without restrictions
- **Cross-host export/import**: requires the target host to use **identical `root_dir` and `run_dir`** (default: `/var/lib/cocoon` and `/var/lib/cocoon/run`) and have the **same OCI image pulled**
- **CPU/memory overrides**: not supported on clone/restore — Firecracker cannot change machine config after snapshot/load; `--cpu` and `--memory` flags are rejected if they differ from the snapshot values
- **Drive path redirect**: Cocoon uses a temporary symlink to redirect the source COW path to the clone's COW during `snapshot/load`. This requires a COW flock to serialize with concurrent operations

This is a fundamental Firecracker design limitation. Cloud Hypervisor snapshots do not have this restriction because CH stores device config in a patchable JSON format (`config.json`).

**Upstream fix in progress**: Firecracker [PR #5774](https://github.com/firecracker-microvm/firecracker/pull/5774) adds `drive_overrides` to the `PUT /snapshot/load` API, which would eliminate the symlink redirect and make FC snapshots natively portable. Track this PR for future simplification.

## Firecracker virtio-blk serial numbers

Firecracker does not support virtio-blk serial numbers. Cocoon's OCI init script (`overlay.sh`) uses device paths (`/dev/vdX`) instead of serial names to identify disks when booting under Firecracker. OCI images built from `os-image/ubuntu/overlay.sh` (v0.3+) support both formats automatically. Older images must be rebuilt to work with `--fc`.

## Cloudimg post-restart snapshot includes orphan `cidata.img`

When a cloudimg VM is snapshotted **after** it has been stopped and started at least once, the resulting snapshot tar still contains a `cidata.img` file even though the snapshot's `cocoon.json` sidecar and CH `config.json` no longer reference cidata. This is because `hypervisor/cloudhypervisor/snapshot.go` copies `cidata.img` whenever the source VM's `runDir` has it (cloudimg + non-Windows), regardless of whether `activeDisks(rec)` would have re-attached it.

**Consequence**: ~1 MB of dead weight inside the tar. No correctness impact:

- Clone from such a snapshot regenerates a fresh `cidata.img` via `ensureCloneCidata` and overwrites the orphan with the clone's identity / network config.
- Restore wipes the orphan via `cleanSnapshotFiles` before staging the snapshot back into the runDir.

This predates the data-disk feature; the cocoon.json sidecar just makes the asymmetry visible. We are not patching the copy logic because the orphan is harmless and the Cidata-disk file is small and reflinked.

## Firecracker clone guest MAC address

Firecracker does not support overriding the guest MAC address during snapshot/load. Cloned FC VMs retain the source VM's guest MAC (baked into the vmstate binary). In Cocoon's TC redirect architecture, each VM runs in an isolated network namespace, so MAC identity is not visible to other VMs or the host bridge — **no MAC conflict occurs in practice**.

On CNI plugins with strict per-veth MAC enforcement (Cilium eBPF, Calico eBPF), the guest MAC vs veth MAC mismatch could theoretically cause packet drops. This has not been observed in testing with the standard bridge CNI.

**Upstream status**: FC's `NetworkOverride` struct only has `iface_id` and `host_dev_name` — no `guest_mac` field. Adding it would follow the existing `VsockOverride` pattern. No issue or PR exists yet.

**Workaround**: If MAC matching is required, run `ip link set dev ethX address <new-mac>` inside the guest after clone (the post-clone hints print the expected MAC values).

## Vhost-user-fs requires VM-level shared memory

`cocoon vm fs attach` only works on CH VMs that were created with `--shared-memory`. CH's `memory shared=on` is fixed at VM creation: backend processes (e.g. virtiofsd) need to mmap guest memory via the negotiated memfd, and the memory model cannot be flipped on a running VM. If `--shared-memory` was omitted at create time, the only path is to recreate the VM. Cocoon's preflight reads `vm.info` and surfaces a clear error rather than letting CH return a vague rejection.

## Snapshotting a VM with attached vhost-user-fs / VFIO is rejected by CH

Cloud Hypervisor refuses to snapshot a VM that holds a vhost-user-fs share or a VFIO PCI passthrough device. Cocoon does not block the call client-side (the rejection comes from CH itself); the surfaced error explains the cause. `cocoon vm fs detach` / `cocoon vm device detach` first to clear runtime devices, then snapshot.

## Runtime attached devices do not survive VM stop / clone / restore

Attaches via `cocoon vm fs attach` and `cocoon vm device attach` are runtime-only — they live in the CH process state and are never written into the VM record, sidecar, or snapshot. After `vm stop`, `vm clone`, or `vm restore`, the user must re-run the attach commands. `vm inspect` reflects the live CH `vm.info` for running VMs and omits `attached_devices` for stopped VMs. This is by design: cocoon does not own the backend (virtiofsd / vfio-pci binding) and cannot guarantee the resource still exists across host events.
